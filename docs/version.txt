V1.0.3:  It builds!

Having cracked cx_Freeze now we want to know how good we are!  So next step i crack some kind of score keeping, possibly
an object controlled by the game object, based on the StatTracker printing out a player score in that cool font!

More update will include blocking objects, they stop movement and bullets but can't destroyed.  These will look like
walls, buildings etc.

Also included in this build is a copy of the tech plan!  This is an unordered set of ideas so I don't forget them.

And!  This doc moved to a new docs folder!  Getting organised!

V7:  So what do shells do again?

Oh I know!  Blow things up!  This is going to be the first release version.  Therefore this will be set as Tank-Game 1.0!
In this release we have actually commented the code.
Also added some more detail to the tank body image and added transparency to all the images so that's clearly a good
thing right?!

In this release there's a few new classes, in the form of destroyables and non-destroyables.  The non-destroyables will
most likely be walls and buildings for the player and the target ot hide behind.  Destroyables will be targets and also
what the main enemy class will derive from!

V6:  The big one!

The game is coming together now, the main player classes are written and have now been broken out into files.

Decoupling has been done so the game object does very little of the updating.

The flow is this:
Game.update(args) -> Tank.update(args)  -> Turret.update(args)  ->*num of shells->  Shell.update(args)
                     Updates the tank      Updates the turret                        Updates each shell

Game.draw_objects()

This release is again housekeeping,  mainly comment writing and moving the classes into their own files.

Next version: Targets (albeit stationary ones...)!
